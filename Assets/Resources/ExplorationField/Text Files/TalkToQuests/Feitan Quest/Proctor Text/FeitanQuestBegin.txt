...no no, this is not good... /speaker (you) Hi, is something wrong? /speaker Feitan Oh, hello there. It's not often I get visitors out here. It isn't safe here lately, you should probably head back home. /speaker (you) I can handle myself, don't worry. Do you know anything about whats been going on here lately? /speaker Feitan *sigh* A confident one huh. Well don't say I didn't warn you, those ...things... are viscious.. and to think Soffie and Lester are still out there... /speaker (you) Someone is out in the forest? /speaker Feitan Regrettably... at night my brother and sister went out to the crystal pond and they havent been back since. I don't know what I would do if something happened to them! /speaker (you) That doesn't sound good. I'm going out there to figure out exactly what's going on, I'll make sure to bring back your brother and sister too for sure! /speaker Feitan I can't support you going out there...but I can't stop you either. If you do find them though, please bring them back home safe! They don't stand a chance against those things...  /speaker (you) I can't just stand idly by knowing what they might be going through right now. I promise I'll bring them back in no time!
